### Conventions
The following is a list of conventions that are strongly recommended to use in the source code:

* Four-space indent
* Two line breaks between code blocks where possible
* Camel-case for variable, functions / method and module names
* Spaces between operators and operands where possible; and possibly between function / class names and their parentheses
